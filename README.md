üìÅ **Collection of Basic Python Practice**  

Welcome to my Python Practice Repository! üëã

This collection features a variety of Python practice problems that cover the essentials of Python programming. Each file showcases my journey in mastering the basics‚Äîfrom handling simple data types to exploring libraries like NumPy and working with regular expressions.

## üèÜ Key Skills Demonstrated  
- **Data Types**: Boolean, Integers, Floats, Strings, Lists, Dictionaries  
- **Control Flow**: Loops, Conditionals  
- **Functions & File Handling**: Understanding and implementation of custom functions and file handling in Python  
- **Functional Programming**: Map, Reduce, Filter techniques  
- **NumPy**: Basic array manipulations and operations  
- **Regular Expressions**: Pattern matching and string manipulations
